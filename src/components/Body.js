            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m an undergraduate student at Northeastern University with a deep fascination for computer science, especially software development. My interests span across various subfields, including competitive programming, quantum computing, and website design. As a full stack developer, I’ve gained experience in a wide range of languages and frameworks, allowing me to build and contribute to diverse projects. Outside of the world of programming, I enjoy cubing, playing cricket and football, and immersing myself in video games.</p>
